# LED-clock-AtMega164A
LED clock with 7-segment display, calendar and alarm using AtMega164A

## Software description
> Port A has analog inputs to the Analog to Digital Converter and they are 8-bit bi-directional input/output port if the A/D converter is not used.
We connected the A-G pins that correspond to the leds of the 7 segment(both 4x7 segment and single 7segment). These connections were made in series with a 1.6 KΩ resistors for each connection to protect the leds by limiting the current. 
The output pin is initialized with DDRA and we wrote its value using PORTA. 
```
// Port A initialization
// Function: Bit7=Out Bit6=Out Bit5=Out Bit4=Out Bit3=Out Bit2=Out Bit1=Out Bit0=Out 
DDRA=(1<<DDA7) | (1<<DDA6) | (1<<DDA5) | (1<<DDA4) | (1<<DDA3) | (1<<DDA2) | (1<<DDA1) | (1<<DDA0);

```
 >Port B are 8-bit bi-directional input/output port. We use it to initialize the push buttons that modify the minutes, hours and enters in the alarm mode.
```
// Port B initialization
// Function: Bit7=In Bit6=In Bit5=In Bit4=In Bit3=In Bit2=In Bit1=In Bit0=In 
DDRB=(0<<DDB7) | (0<<DDB6) | (0<<DDB5) | (0<<DDB4) | (0<<DDB3) | (0<<DDB2) | (0<<DDB1) | (0<<DDB0);
// State: Bit7=P Bit6=P Bit5=P Bit4=P Bit3=P Bit2=P Bit1=P Bit0=P 
PORTB=(1<<PORTB7) | (1<<PORTB6) | (1<<PORTB5) | (1<<PORTB4) | (1<<PORTB3) | (1<<PORTB2) | (1<<PORTB1) | (1<<PORTB0);
```

>Port C are 8-bit bi-directional input/output port and they have JTAG interface ( Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan). 
>We use port C to connect the base of the transistors in series with a 1kΩ resistor. Resistor limits the current flowing into the base of the transistor to prevent it being damaged, but it must also allow sufficient base current to flow to ensure that the transistor is fully saturated when switched on
```
// Port C initialization
// Function: Bit7=Out Bit6=Out Bit5=Out Bit4=Out Bit3=Out Bit2=Out Bit1=Out Bit0=Out 
DDRC=(1<<DDC7) | (1<<DDC6) | (1<<DDC5) | (1<<DDC4) | (1<<DDC3) | (1<<DDC2) | (1<<DDC1) | (1<<DDC0);
// State: Bit7=1 Bit6=1 Bit5=1 Bit4=1 Bit3=1 Bit2=1 Bit1=1 Bit0=1 
PORTC=(1<<PORTC7) | (1<<PORTC6) | (1<<PORTC5) | (1<<PORTC4) | (1<<PORTC3) | (1<<PORTC2) | (1<<PORTC1) | (1<<PORTC0);
```

>Port D are 8-bit bi-directional input/output port. We use it to make the LED that was already on the board to blink when the alarm is set.
```
// Port D initialization
// Function: Bit7=Out Bit6=Out Bit5=Out Bit4=Out Bit3=Out Bit2=Out Bit1=Out Bit0=Out 
DDRD=(1<<DDD7) | (1<<DDD6) | (1<<DDD5) | (1<<DDD4) | (1<<DDD3) | (1<<DDD2) | (1<<DDD1) | (1<<DDD0);
// State: Bit7=0 Bit6=0 Bit5=0 Bit4=0 Bit3=0 Bit2=0 Bit1=0 Bit0=0 
PORTD=(0<<PORTD7) | (0<<PORTD6) | (0<<PORTD5) | (0<<PORTD4) | (0<<PORTD3) | (0<<PORTD2) | (0<<PORTD1) | (0<<PORTD0);
```


> In order to make the LED blink in alarm mode, we are using the PORTD that has been initialized at the beginning.
```

if(alarm==1)//when alarm is enabled

{

PORTD |=(1<<6); //alarm led on

}

else

{

 PORTD&=~(1<<6);  //when alarm is enabled

}

      }
}```

>Interrupt is serviced by a C function called ISR (Interrupt Service  Routine).Timer1 output compare A is used to blink LED. 
```
//Interruption mechanism allows the microcontroller to respond to external events, or to events generated by chip peripherals.
interrupt [TIM0_COMPA] void timer0_compa_isr(void)```

>We initialized a timer that will refresh the digit after each count. This corresponds with the timer_0 defined in line 57.
